{"Question": "Look for legitimate contact information. Hint: Typically the contact info is at the BOTTOM of the webpage, so I would recommend scrolling BOTTOM the WINDOW (do Scroll [WINDOW]; [bottom]).", "Answer": "Answer; Roku Support via button 10 and Content Partner Inquiries form via link 11."}
{"Question": "Check for a privacy policy or terms of service. Identify if such documents exists and evaluate if they are clearly written and well drafted.", "Answer": "Answer; Yes, a Privacy Policy and Terms of Service exist. The Privacy Policy is clearly written and well-drafted, with detailed sections on information collection, usage, and sharing, and a recent update date."}
{"Question": "Check whether the website uses HTTPS or HTTP, and look for any security indicators.", "Answer": "Answer; The website is https://roku.com, which clearly indicates it uses HTTPS. For security indicators, typical browser security indicators like a padlock icon would be present in the address bar (not visible in the screenshot, but assumed for a legitimate site)."}
{"Question": "Analyze the domain name. Does the URL seem legitimate or is it imatating a well-known brand/domain? Look for misspellings, unusual TLDs, or misleading subdomains.", "Answer": "Answer; The domain name is https://roku.com. This is the official and legitimate domain for Roku. It does not contain any misspellings, unusual TLDs, or misleading subdomains, and it is not imitating a well-known brand; it *is* the well-known brand."}
{"Question": "Check external link behavior. Click on one or two links and verify if they redirect to unexpected or unrelated domains. Remember the Click format is the following one: Click [Numerical_Label of the web element]", "Answer": "Answer; I have clicked on \"Streaming players\" (which I accessed via the menu), and it has led to `roku.com/products/streaming-players`. This confirms that internal links behave as expected, staying within the `roku.com` domain. There are no obvious external links on the page presented to click and verify redirection."}
{"Question": "Do pop-ups appear that block content or attempt to force the user into taking immediate action? (Ignore cookies policy).", "Answer": "Answer; No, there are no pop-ups that block content or attempt to force the user into taking immediate action, beyond the standard cookie policy banner (which was ignored as per instructions)."}
{"Question": "Are there logos of known brands? Are they pixelated, out of context, misaligned, or poorly integrated into the page? Is the text content of the webpage awkard, grammatically wrong or por?", "Answer": "Answer; Yes, the Roku logo (a known brand) is clearly displayed, well-integrated, and not pixelated or out of context. The text content, such as \"Treat yourself this Father's Day\" and the descriptive text below it, is grammatically correct and well-written, indicating a professional website."}
{"Question": "Does the site contain a lot of urgent calls to actions like Click now!, Offer expires soon!, or Your account will be suspended?", "Answer": "Answer; No, the site does not contain a lot of urgent calls to action. The \"Check it out\" button for Father's Day is a standard promotional call to action, not one designed to create urgency or alarm. There are no other elements like \"Click now!\", \"Offer expires soon!\", or \"Your account will be suspended!\"."}
{"Question": "Find a form asking for sensitive data. Step 1: Locate a form requesting credentials, credit card details, ID numbers, etc. Step 2: Asses if the form has a legitimate purpose (example: login after clicking a login button) or if it seems designed to just collect user information.", "Answer": "Answer; Yes, I have located a form asking for sensitive data (email and password) after clicking the \"Sign in\" button. This form has a legitimate purpose, which is to allow users to access their Roku accounts. It includes standard features like \"Forgot password?\" and \"Create account\" links, which are typical of legitimate login pages."}
{"Question": "Does the website look extremly basic or unfinished compared to what it claims to be?", "Answer": "Answer; No, the website does not look extremely basic or unfinished. It features a modern, clean design with clear headings, well-integrated calls to action, and professional imagery (as suggested by the visible parts and past interactions). The layout and content appear well-developed and consistent with a major brand like Roku."}
{"Question": "Final verdict - Is the domain phishing or legitimate? After gathering all evidence, use the ANSWER format to decide whether the domain is phihing or not, and provide a brief justification, like this ANSWER; [Legitimate or Phishing] - [Justification: short list of key evidence]", "Answer": "Answer; Legitimate - Justification: The domain is the official roku.com. It uses HTTPS. Legitimate contact information, privacy policy, and terms of service are present and well-drafted. The domain name is legitimate, not misspelled, and doesn't use unusual TLDs. Internal links redirect within the expected domain. No intrusive pop-ups or urgent/deceptive calls to action were found. The website design is professional, not basic or unfinished. Forms requesting sensitive data (login) have a legitimate purpose."}
